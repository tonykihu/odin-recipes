**Introduction**

Welcome to the Recipe Website project! This project is designed to help you practice and apply your HTML skills by building a basic recipe website. The goal is to create a simple yet functional website that features a main index page with links to several recipe pages. While the design may be minimal and not visually appealing at this stage, the focus is on understanding the structure and functionality of HTML.

Project Structure
Index Page: The main page that will serve as a hub for the recipe links.
Recipe Pages: Individual pages dedicated to specific recipes, linked from the index page.
Skills Demonstrated
Upon completing this project, you will have demonstrated the following skills:

HTML Structure: Understanding and implementing the fundamental elements of HTML, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, and links.
Linking Pages: Creating a navigation system by linking the index page to the recipe pages, enhancing the user experience.
Semantic HTML: Utilizing semantic tags to improve the accessibility and searchability of the website.
Basic Web Development Concepts: Gaining familiarity with the foundational concepts of web development, including how webpages are structured and interconnected.
Reflection
As I work through this project, I will reflect on my learning journey, including challenges faced and solutions found. This self-reflection will serve as a valuable tool for recognizing growth and understanding how to apply HTML skills in future projects.

Remember, this project is just the beginning! We will revisit this website in the future to enhance its aesthetics with CSS and other styling techniques.
